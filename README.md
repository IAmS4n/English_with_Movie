# English with Movie

A web-based video player to leverage movies for practicing language skills.
There is a demo for Persian speakers in [this link](https://iams4n.github.io/English_with_Movie/).
The player gets a movie with two language subtitles, then it plays video dialog by dialog with an automatic pause and shows two subtitles simultaneously.
It has some combinations of different modes for practicing different skills.
The listening part is based on hiding the subtitles and normal play of the video.
The speaking part is based on showing just subtitle that is related to native language and muting the video.
